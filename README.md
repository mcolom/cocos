Great 1997's Pacman-like game (Pascal and x86 ASM code)!

I make this Pacman-like game along with my brother in 1997. I did the coding and he did the graphics.
It's made in Turbo Pascal with pieces of x86 assembly,
I'm publishing this code here just for archival reasons, and of course I wouldn't recommend anyone to learn about programming by looking at this code. I remember having see even a "goto" in there! :)

I gave it the name "Almudeno el gran devorador de cocos" because of a girlfriend I had at the time. She disliked the name and my brother even more :P
When finished, I sent the game to the PCMania magazine and they published it. It was a great surprise when I bought the magazine and I saw my game right there inside the CD that came along. An image of that CD containing a working copy of the game can be downloaded from archive.org, here: https://archive.org/download/PCMCDS/PCMania%20CD68_1.iso

I hope you'll like it!
